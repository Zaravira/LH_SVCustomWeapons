# Description
This mod removes the limitations in the custom weapon crafting window on most boosters and modifiers, allowing for increased freedom in weapon designs.
The limits are the design's spiralling heat and energy costs, your tech level, and your ship's heat/energy limitations.

# Installing
Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. 
You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
